This repository contains **Readme Banners** (and some useful docs) that can be used by OSS projects to spread the word, support and help Ukraine in this disastrous situation. Like this **(click to open)**:

# Windows Registry Defrag
## Windows 98, 2000, XP registry defragmentation

Initially, this project was implemented as a commercial for Design Creation Implementation LLC (DCI).

There is no support for Windows Vista and higher, and no time to do this support. For these reasons, I publish the original
project source codes. Perhaps the source code **will be useful to someone**.

The programing language is Delphi 7.

### I don't give any guarantees that this source code:
is operational on Windows operating systems and doesn't cause damage. Publish exclusively for studying the source code and registry defragmentation algorithms.

### I don't bear any responsibility:
if someone compiles this source code and distributes it as a program providing.

### I don't publish any executable or binary files:
This publication is solely documentary, educational character.

### If you want to make such a software products:
it‚Äôs impossible to refer to my source code as causing damage,

## Try compiling and using - you do it at your own risk.
